# Planning:

English words will be strings
Those words will be converted to strings of phonetic characters
Vowels and consonants will be paired together to create a list of strings, each string corresponding to one Tunic rune

Vowels: ee, a, ih, eh, ah, uu, oo, up, er, ur, ar, or, ow, ay, oh, i, oy, ?
Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, ch, j, f, v, th, Th, s, z, sh, zh, h, m, n, ng, l, r, y, w
